<h2>Example - Oil refinery (Sys Ineq)</h2>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#example1">Example 1</button>
  <div id="example1" class="collapse">
 <P> The maximum daily production of an oil refinery is 2300 barrels. It makes 3 kinds of fuel: gasoline, diesel, and heating oil.
   Gasoline has a production cost of $6 per barrel. Diesel has a production cost of $5 per barrel, and heating oil has a production cost of $8 per barrel.
   The daily production budget is $16400. Can you write inequalities governing the number of barrels of each fuel produced?

  <div id="ex3" class="collapse">
<p> The Mathematical Association of America (MAA) plans a 3-day conference at a big hotel with many conference rooms.

  The hotel rents rooms at a rate of $17 per room for a single day rental, or $30 to rent a room for consecutive days.
  Can you set up a linear programming problem to figure out how the MAA should rent rooms to minimize the rental cost?
  You do not need to find a solution. (hint: think about how many ways there are to rent rooms for a single day and consecutive days.)

  <div id="ex4" class="collapse">
<p> A mining company operates two mines, each of which produces three grades of ore.

  The North Ridge mine can produce 2 tons of low-grade ore, 1 ton of medium-grade ore, and 2 tons of high-grade ore per hour of operation.
  To satisfy existing orders, the company needs at least 100 tons of low-grade ore, 60 tons of medium-grade ore, and 80 tons of high-grade ore.
  The cost of operating each mine varies, depending on the conditions encountered while extracting the ore.
  <ol>
    <li>If it costs $400 per hour to operate the West Summit mine and $600 to operate the North Ridge mine, how many hours should each mine be operated to supply the required amounts of ore and minimize production costs? What is the minimum production cost?
    <li>Discuss the effect on the production schedule and the minimum production cost if it costs $300 per hour to operate West Summit and 700 per hour to operate North Ridge. Assume everything else stays the same.
    <li>What if it cost $800 per hour to operate West Summit and $200 per hour to operate North Ridge?

  These shifts are shown in the table above with x's.
  Because some shifts are more/less desirable than others, the daily wages differ for each shift.
  The daily wages for shifts 1-5 are $170, $160, $175, $180, $195, respectively.

    <li>Can you determine how many people should be assigned to each shift to minimize the total personnel cost while meeting, or surpassing, the minimum service agent requirements?
    <li> How does this problem compare to the <a href="./United_Airlines_Station_Manpower_Planning_System.pdf">United Airlines problem from the paper</a> assigned for today? What is similar? What additional constraints did UA have to deal with? What other problems did they solve?
