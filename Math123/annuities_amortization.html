            <P> Lori and Mike want to buy a house and move out of their tiny apartment. After studying thier budget, the determine that they can afford $1600 a month to cover mortgage payments and other costs of owning a house.

              <P> When taking out a mortgage a point is simply 1% of the loan amount. In the mortgage
process, a bank typically offers people several loan options. These loan options will have different interest
rates but in order to get a lower rate, one must pay the bank by paying points. In a way this can be
thought of a prepaying interest to the bank. For example, let’s look at a couple buying a house for
$150,000. Let’s assume they put 20% down, so the loan amount is $120,000. We will neglect any closing costs associated with the mortgage.
 A bank may offer these people a 30 year loan option with a 4% annual interest rate compounded monthly and another option
with a 3.75% interest rate if they pay 1 point at the beginning of the loan. Which option is better for
this couple? It depends on how many months they plan on staying in the house. (Many people do not
stay in a home for the entire length of their mortgage.) If they live there a short time they may not
recoup the money they paid upfront in lower monthly payments. Determine the number of months the couple must stay in the house for paying points to be worth it.
