<h2>Example 1 - Laboratory Diets</h2>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#ex1">Example 1</button>
  <div id="ex1" class="collapse">
    <P>You are working in a laboratory that does experiments with animals.
      The animals in one particular experiment are to be kept on a strict diet of 20 grams of protein and 6 grams of fat each day.
      There are two food mixes the lab uses. Mix \(A\) has 10% protein and 6% fat.
      Mix \(B\) has 20% protein and 2% fat.
      Your task is to determine how many grams of each mix should be used to obtain the right diet for a single animal.

      <ol>
        <li>What are the unknowns in this problem?
        <li>How many equations do you need? What do they represent? Units?
        <li>What are the equations?
        <li>Draw the graphs for these equations in one figure.
        <li>Solve the equations you've set up.
        </ol>

    <P>Solve the systems below if possible.
    <ol type='A'>
    <li>$$2x - y = 1$$
      $$2x + y = -3$$
    <li>$$6x - 9y = 8$$
      $$10x - 15y = -20$$

<h2>Example 3 - Gifts Galore</h2>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#ex3">Example 3</button>
  <div id="ex3" class="collapse">
    <P>Gifts Galore Catalogue Company estimates the demand for TVs to be
      $$p = -10x + 640,$$
      where \(x\) is demand quantity and \(p\) is price.
      The supply equation is
      $$p = 12.5x + 325,$$
      where \(x\) is supply quantity and \(p\) is price.
      <ul>
        <li>Explain the supply and demand trends exhibited by the equations.
        <li>Find the equilibrium price.

<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#ex4">Example 4</button>
  <div id="ex4" class="collapse">
    <P>What if the Gifts Galore company saw demand for a waffle iron is
    $$p = -2.5x + 148,$$
    and the supply is
    $$p = 1.7x  + 43.$$
    What is the equilibrium point?

<h2>Example 5 - GG part 3</h2>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#ex5">Example 5</button>
  <div id="ex5" class="collapse">
    <P>Now the Gifts Galore company has data indicating that when the
      price is $138, the demand is 72 and the supply 96.
      The equilibrium point occurs when the price is $120 and the quantity is 88.
      Find the equations for the supply and demand.

  <h2>Example 6 - Lean manufacturing</h2>
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#ex6">Example 6</button>
  <div id="ex6" class="collapse">

  <P><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_Six_Sigma">Lean</a> <a href="https://www.leanproduction.com/">manufacturing</a> is a corporate philosophy or operation strategy built around eliminating waste. This includes waste in inventory, production, and labor.

  <P>Consider a factory that makes down jackets, vests, and comforters. A jacket requires 3 lbs of down, a vest 2 lbs, and a comforter 4 lbs.
    A jacket takes 2 hours of labor to make, a vest requires 1 hour of labor, and a comforter also requires 1 hour.
    The profit from jackets and vests are $6 each, and the profit from a comforter is $2.

  <P>Each week the factory has exactly 600 pounds of down, 275 available manhours and wants a weekly profit of $1150. How many jackets, vests, and comforters should it produce in order to eliminate any excesses in down and labor hours?
