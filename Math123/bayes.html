  <div id="ex1" class="collapse">
<p> Consider two urns that contain balls. Urn 1 has 3 blue and 2 white balls. Urn 2 has 1 blue and 3 white balls.
  A single six-sided die is rolled and if a 1 or 2 comes up, a ball is drawn from urn 1.
  Otherwise a ball is drawn from urn 2.
  If the ball drawn is blue, what is the probability that it came from urn 1? from urn 2?

  <div id="ex2" class="collapse">
<p> A new, inexpensive skin test is devised for detecting tuberculosis.
  To evaluate the test before it is put into use, a medical researcher randomly selects 1000 people.
  Using a precise, but more expensive method already available, it si found that 8% of the 1000 people have TB.
  Now each of the subjects is given the new skin test and the following results are recorded: The test indicates TB in 96% of theose who have it and in 2% of those who do not.
  Based on these results, what is the probability of a randomly chosen person having TB given that the skin test indicates the disease?
  What is the probability of a person not having tuberculosis given that the skin test indicates the disease?
  What is the probability of a person having TB given that the skin test indicates no disease is present?

  <P> A company produces 1000 refridgerators a week at three plants. Plant A produces 350 refridgerators a week, plant B produces 250 a week, and plant C produces 400 refridgerators a week.
    Production records indicate that 5% of the refridgerators from plant A will be defective, 3% from plant B, and 7% from plant C.
    All refridgerators are shipped to a central warehouse. If a randomly selected refridgerator at the warehouse is found to be defective, what is the probability it came from plant A?
