      <P>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derangement">derangement</a> is a permutation of the elements of a set, such that no element appears in its original position.<br>
      <ul>
        <li>For example consider the set {A,B,C,D,E}. Consider this the originial order.<br>
        <li>BACED is not a derangement because C still appears in the third position - same as in the original order.<br>
        <li>CDAEB is a derangement. <br>
        </ul>

      <ol>
        <li>How many derangments are there of the set {A,B,C}?
          <ul><li>How many ways are there to order the elements of this set? Can you list them all?</li></ul>
        <li>How many derangments are there of the set {A,B,C,D}?
          <ul><li>How many ways are there to order the elements of this set?</li><li>Hint: a tree diagram may help here</li></ul>

<h2>Example - Seating charts</h2>

  <div id="ex6" class="collapse">
  <P>Sometimes people just don’t get along, and you are caught in the middle. Imagine
that you are a wedding planner organizing the rehearsal dinner before a big wedding.
There are a total of 16 people attending the rehearsal dinner: A, B, C, ..., H
are relatives of the bride and groom; I, J, K, Á P are members of the wedding party. If things weren’t stressful enough, you are told that some of these people
have serious issues:
<ul>
<li>A doesn’t get along with F,G, or H,
<li>B doesn’t get along with C,D, or H,
<li>C doesn’t get along with B,D, E, G, or H,
<li>D doesn’t get along with B, C, or E,
<li>E doesn’t get along with C,D, F, or G,
<li>F doesn’t get along with A, E, or G,
<li>G doesn’t get along with A, C, E, or F,
<li>H doesn’t get along with A, B, or C.
</ul>
To make the rehearsal dinner go smoothly you are instructed to find a way to
seat these people so that people that don’t get along must be seated at different
tables. (I through P get along with everyone, so they are not a concern.) How are
you going to set up the seating arrangements with so many incompatibility issues
to worry about? What is the minimum number of tables you will need?
