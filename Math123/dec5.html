<h2>Example 1 </h2>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#ex1">Example 1</button>
  <div id="ex1" class="collapse">
<p> A large computer company, A, subcontracts the manufacturing of circuit boards to companies B and C, 40% and 60%, respectively. Company B then subcontracts 70% of its orders to company D and 30% to company E. All ship their boards back to A.
  Quality control at A has found that 0.5%, 1.5%, and 1% of the boards made by C, D, and E, respectively, are defective during the 90 warranty period. What is the probability that a computer sold by A is defective?
</div>

<h2>Example 2 </h2>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#ex2">Example 2</button>
  <div id="ex2" class="collapse">
<p> Consider a box with 3 blue and 2 white balls. We pick out 2 balls one at a time. What is the probability that the second ball is white if we replace the first ball versus without replacement?

<h2>Example 3</h2>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#ex3">Example 3</button>

    <div id="ex4" class="collapse">
    <P> The National Lung Association surveyed 2000 women. 680 are smokers, and 50 have emphysema. 42 respondents are smokers who have emphysema. Do these results suggest smoking and emphysema are independent events?
