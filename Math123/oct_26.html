<h2>Example 1 - Home prices</h2>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#ex1">Example 1</button>
  <div id="ex1" class="collapse">
<p>  The National Association of Realtors estimates that the average home price in Omaha, Nebraska was $75,600 in 1990 and $135,200 in 2008. Determine approximately the average annual rate of inflation of home prices in that 18-year period.

</div>

<h2>Example 2 - Loan choices</h2>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#ex2">Example 2</button>
  <div id="ex2" class="collapse">
<p>  A jeweler wants to obtain a $3000 loan for 4 months. She has the choice of a simple interest loan at 10.3% or a discount loan at 10.1%. (The discount rate is a percentage of the maturity value - not the proceeds.) Which one will result in the lower fee for the use of the money?
</div>

<h2>Example 3 - Investment choices</h2>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#ex3">Example 3</button>
  <div id="ex3" class="collapse">
<p> Which is the better investment, one with 5.0% compounded annually or 4.92% compounded monthly?
</div>

<h2>Example 4 - Selling your car to a friend </h2>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#ex4">Example 4</button>
  <div id="ex4" class="collapse">
  <P> Suppose after buying a new car you sell your old car to a friend. You accept a 9-month note (loan) for $3500 at 10% simple interest per year as payment.
    2 months later you find that you need cash and sell the note to a third party for $3550. Is this person getting a better deal? By how much is it better or worse in terms of interest rates?
  </div>

  <h2>Example 5 - New tax rates? </h2>
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#ex5">Example 5</button>
    <div id="ex5" class="collapse">
    <P> Currently congress is considering a restructuring of the tax system with fewer tax brackets than the current system. The proposed brackets for single filers are shown in the table below.
      The proposed brackets have not been announced, although there has been talk of making the highest bracket for millionaires, but let's assume they are otherwise close to current brackets.
      In addition the personal exemption of $4050 in the current plan is removed in the proposed plan, but the standard deduction has been increased from $6350 to $12,000.<br>
      Calculate the difference in tax for a single filer with an income of $40,000, $2000 in adjustments, and taking the standard deduction. How does this change for a person making $60,000? (Assume the same adjustments and standard deduction.)<br>

        <p> The parents of a child have just come into a large inheritance and wish to establish a trust fund for her college education.
          If they estimate that they will need $100,000 in 13 years, how much should they set aside in the trust now if they can invest the money at 8.5% per year compounded quarterly?
