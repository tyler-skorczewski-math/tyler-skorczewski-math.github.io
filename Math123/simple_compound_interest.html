<h2>Example - Store sale</h2>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#ex1">Example </button>
  <div id="ex1" class="collapse">
<p>  Suppose you plan on having a sale of a popular item to get people into your store.
  You need a short-term loan of $10,000 to buy items, but you will be able to pay back the loan in 3 months after the sale.
  The bank offers a loan with simple interest at 8% per year interest. How much do you pay?
</div>

<h2>Example  - </h2>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#ex2">Example </button>
  <div id="ex2" class="collapse">
    <p> $2000 is invested in a trust fund that pays 6% per year simple interest.
      What is the amount in the fund at the end of the 10 years?
</div>

<h2>Example  - </h2>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#ex2a">Example </button>

    <p> If you loan your brother $200 and he pays you back 1 month later with $250, what was the interest rate?

  <div id="ex3" class="collapse">
    <P>A Treasury bill is a government backed loan. Instead of paying interest, they specify the amount paid back, or maturity value,
      and banks bid on how much to buy them for.
<ul>
  <li> Ex. A 26-week T-Bill with a maturity value of $10,000. Suppose a bank bids, and wins, to buy the loan for $9750.
    What is the rate of return on this investment?
  </ul>
</div>

<h2>Example - </h2>

  <P> A friend loans you $900 if you pay them back $1000 in 4 months.
    <ol>
      <li>Is this a simple interest or simple discount situation?
      <li>What is the interest rate or discount rate?
      </ol>

  <P> A bank is considering two short term investment options. One is a secure bond that will return 3% simple interest.
    The other is a 3 month T-Bill with a $1 million maturity value.
    What is the most the bank should bid on the T-Bill if it wants it to be the better option?
    </div>

    2 months later you find you need cash and sell the note to someone else for $3550.
    Is this person getting a better deal?
    By how much is it better or worse in terms of interest rate?

    <P> <b>Question</b> What is the difference between the Annual Percentage Yield (APY) and the Annual Interest Rate (APR)? Note that APY is also called effective rate sometimes.
    <P> Come up with a formula to calculate the APY given the APR and how often interest is compounded.

<h2>Example - APY </h2>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#ex10">Example </button>
