  <li> What is the equation of the line through the points (2,3) and (9,24)?<br><br>
  <li> Raul is on a carefully supervised diet that causes weight loss of 3 pounds per week.
    After 14 weeks, his weight is 196 pounds. Does the information provided give two points or a point and a slope?
    Write Raul's weight as a linear function of weeks on the diet.<br><br>
  <li> Gabby starts a flower shop with fixed costs of $600 per month. Bouquets sell for an average of $20 each and cost $10 to produce.
    How many does she need to sell to make a profit?<br><br>
  <li> Solve
    $$2x + 3y = 6$$
    $$5x - 6y = 10$$

<li> Graph the solution set to the system:<br>
  \(x - 3y \geq 6\)<br>
  \(x - y \leq 4\)<br>
  \(y \geq -5\)<br><br>
<li> Maximize \(z = 5x + 4y\) <br>subject to<br>
  \(3x + 2y \leq 12\)<br>
  \(x + y \leq 5\)<br>
  \( x\geq 0, y \geq 0\)<br><br>
<li> The Hoover Steel Mill produces two grades of stainless steel, which is sold in 100-pound bars.
  The standard grade is 90% steel and 10% chromium by weight, and the premium grade is 80% steel and 20% chromium.
  The company has 80,000 pounds of steel and 12,000 pounds of chromium on hand.
  If the price per bar is $90 for the standard grade and $100 for the premium grade, set up a linear programming problem to determine
  how much of each grade should it produce to maximize revenue? You do not need to solve this.<br><br>
<li> A school cafeteria serves three foods for lunch: A, B, and C.
  There is pressure on the cafeteria director to reduce lunch costs.
  Help the director by finding the quantities of each food that will minimize costs and still maintain the desired nutritional level.
  The three foods have the following nutritional characteristics:<br>
  <img src="./cafeteria_table.png" width=350><br>
  A lunch must contain at least 80 grams of protein, 95 grams of carbohydrates, and 800 calories.
  How many units of each food should be served to minimize cost? Set up the problem. Do not solve.

    <li>Three numbers are drawn from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} and placed in a row in the order drawn to form a three-digit number.
      What is the probability that <br>

        <li>the first digit is 2, 4, or 6?

    <li>Consider owning a landscaping company and bidding on 3 projects. You estimate the chances of winning the bid
      on projects A, B, and C to be 0.7, 0.6, and 0.5, respectively. You also know the chances of winning each are independent.
      Draw a tree diagram to help you determine the probabilty that you win:

        <li>all three bids?<br>
        <li>exactly two bids?<br>

      <li>Lauren attended her 10th high school reunion.

        22 were married and in their second marriage, and 12 were currently single. (a)  (b)  (c)
        <ol>
          <li>If one person is selected at random from the group, find the probability that it is a single person.
          <li>If two people are selected at random, find the probability that both are in their second marriage.
          <li>If three people are selected at random, find the probability that two are in their first marriage and one is single.
