  <h1>Exam 1 review</h1>

<ol type='A'>
<li> What is the equation of the line through points (5,4) and (10,24)?<br><br>
<li> I have 80 books in my office. Three years ago I had 59 books in my office.
  Assuming a linear trend, how many will I have 5 years from now?
  What is the equation of this line?<br><br>
<li> Tony plans to open a bagel shop. He estimates his weekly costs are:
  <ul>
    <li>rent: $300
    <li>utilities: $130
    <li>salaries: $1800
    <li>insurance: $90
    </ul>
    Bagel ingredients are $0.32 per bagel and the price of a bagel will be $0.95.
    How many bagels does Tony need to sell each week to make a profit? <br><br>
<li> Write down the augmented matrix for the system of equations below. <br>
\( \begin{align*} 6 x_1 + 4x_2 - x_3 &= 0\\ -x_1 + x_2 -x_3 &= 7 \\ 5x_1 \hspace{1.57cm} &= 15 \end{align*} \)<br><br>
<li> The augmented matrix below represents three equations in the variables x,y, and z.
  Write them down. Is there a solution to this system?<br>
  \(\left[ \begin{array}{c c c | c} 4 & 6 & -1 & 9 \\ 3 & 0 & 2 & 1 \\ 0 & 2 & 0 & 0 \end{array} \right]\)<br>
  What if it is changed to this matrix?<br>
  \(\left[ \begin{array}{c c c | c} 4 & 6 & -1 & 9 \\ 3 & 0 & 2 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 2 \end{array} \right]\)<br><br>
<li>  The snack shop makes three mixes of nuts in the following proportions:
<ul>
  <li>Mix I: 7 pounds peanuts, 5 pounds cashews, and 1 pound pecans;
  <li>Mix II: 3 pounds peanuts, 2 pounds cashews, and 2 pound pecans;
  <li>Mix III: 4 pounds peanuts, 3 pounds cashews, and 3 pound pecans.
  </ul>
The shop has 67 pounds of peanuts, 48 pounds of cashews, and 32 pounds of pecans in stock.
Set up a system of equations to determine how much of each mix the store can produce.
You do not need to solve this system.<br><br>
<li> Raul is on a carefully supervised diet that causes weight loss of 3 pounds per week.
  After 14 weeks, his weight is 196 pounds. Does the information provided give two points or a point and a slope?
  Write Raul's weight as a linear function of weeks on the diet.<br><br>
<li> The Catalog Store found that the demand equation for its Belgian waffle iron was \(p = -2.5x + 148\),
  where \(x\) is the demand quantity (in thousands) and \(p\) is the price.
  The supply equation is \(p = 1.7x + 43\), where \(x\) is the supply quantity (in thousands) and \(p\) is the price.
  Find the equilibrium solution.<br><br>
<li>You are working in a laboratory that does experiments with animals.
  The animals in one particular experiment are to be kept on a strict diet of 20 grams protein and 6 grams fat each day.
  There are two food mixes the lab uses. Mix A has 10% protein and 6% fat; mix B has 20% protein and 2% fat.
  Your task is to determine how many grams of each mix should be used to obtain the right diet for a single animal.
