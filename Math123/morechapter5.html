<h2>Example - Retirement planning </h2>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#ex13">Example </button>
  <div id="ex13" class="collapse">
  <P> A person wants to make annual deposits for 25 years into an annuity that earns 9.4% compounded annually in order to retire.
    Once retired they will make 20 equal annual withdrawls of $25,000 reducing the balance of the account to $0.
    How much must be deposited annually to accumulate sufficient funds to provide for these payments? How much total interest is earned during the entire 45 year process?

<h2>Example- Home equity </h2>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#ex14">Example </button>
  <div id="ex14" class="collapse">
  <P> Suppose a couple bought a house 15 years ago for $300,000.
    They made a down payment of 25% of the purchase price and took out a 30 year mortgage on the
    rest at 4.8% per year on the unpaid balance compounded monthly.
    The house is now worth $420,000. How much equity do they have in the house?
  </div>

<h2>Example - Paying Points? </h2>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#ex18">Example</button>
  <div id="ex18" class="collapse">
  <P> When taking out a mortgage a point is simply 1% of the loan amount. In the mortgage
process, a bank typically offers people several loan options. These loan options will have different interest
rates but in order to get a lower rate, one must pay the bank by paying points. In a way this can be
thought of a prepaying interest to the bank. For example, let’s look at a couple buying a house for
$150,000. Let’s assume they put 20% down, so the loan amount is $120,000. We will neglect any closing costs associated with the mortgage.
A bank may offer these people a 30 year loan option with a 4% annual interest rate compounded monthly and another option
with a 3.75% interest rate if they pay 1 point at the beginning of the loan. Which option is better for
this couple? It depends on how many months they plan on staying in the house. (Many people do not
stay in a home for the entire length of their mortgage.) If they live there a short time they may not
recoup the money they paid upfront in lower monthly payments. Determine the number of months the couple must stay in the house for paying points to be worth it.

<ol type='1'>
  <li> How much is 1 point of the loan?
  <li> What is the monthly payment if you don't pay the point and have the 4% interest rate?
  <li> What is the monthly payment if you do pay the point and have the 3.75% interest rate?
  <li> How many months need to pass before the total cost of the point plus the montly payment
    at 3.75% interest is cheaper than the total cost of monthly payments at 4% interest?

  <h2>Example - Home prices</h2>
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#ex1">Example </button>
    <div id="ex1" class="collapse">
  <p>  The National Association of Realtors estimates that the average home price in Omaha, Nebraska was $75,600 in 1990 and $135,200 in 2008. Determine approximately the average annual rate of inflation of home prices in that 18-year period.
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#ex1ans">Solution</button>
      <div id="ex1ans" class="collapse">
      <P>This is a compound interest problem (interest compounded annually) where the initial amount is \(P=75600\), the final amount is \(A=135200\) and the duration is \(t=18\).
        Applying the formula we see:
        <ul>
          <li>\(A = P (1 + i)^n\)
          <li>\(A = P (1 + r)^t\)
          <li>\(135200 = 75600 (1 + r)^{18}\)
          <li>We can solve for \(r\)
          <li>\(r = \left(\frac{135200}{75600}\right)^{1/18} - 1 = 0.0328 = 3.28\%  \)

  <h2>Example  - Loan choices</h2>
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#ex2">Example </button>
    <div id="ex2" class="collapse">
  <p>  A jeweler wants to obtain a $3000 loan for 4 months. She has the choice of a simple interest loan at 10.3% or a discount loan at 10.1%. (The discount rate is a percentage of the maturity value - not the proceeds.) Which one will result in the lower fee for the use of the money?
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#ex2ans">Solution</button>
      <div id="ex2ans" class="collapse">
       <ul>
         <li>For the simple interest loan we have \(I = Prt = 3000(0.103)(4/12) = \$103\).
         <li>For the simple discount loan the fee for the use of the money is the maturity value minus the proceeds, \(M-P\).
         <li>\(M-P = Mdt\) where \(d = 10.1\) is the discount rate, and \(t=4/12\) is the duration.
         <li>Solving for \(M\) we have \(M = \frac{P}{1 - dt} = \frac{3000}{1 - (0.101)(4/12)} = 3104.52\).
         <li>Then \(M - P = \$104.52\) so the simple interst loan is the better deal.

      <div id="ex3ans" class="collapse">
       <ul>
         <li>For this problem we can look at Annual Percentage Yield or effective rates.
         <li>For 5% compounded annually we have the APY \(= (1 + 0.05/1)^{1} - 1 = 0.05\).
         <li>For 4.92% compounded monthly we have the APY \(= (1 + 0.0492/12)^{12} - 1 = 0.050325\).
         <li>The 4.92% investment has the better APY and is a better investment.

      <div id="ex6ans" class="collapse">
