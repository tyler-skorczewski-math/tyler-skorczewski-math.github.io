<P> Newton's Law of Gravitation states that two bodies having masses \(m_1\) and \(m_2\) attract each other with a force
$$ F = G\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}$$
where \(G\) is the gravitational constant and \(r\) is the distance between the two bodies. Assume that the mass of the earth is \(5.97 \times 10^{24}\) kg and is concentrated at the center of the earth,
the radius of the earth is \(6.37 \times 10^6\) m, and \(G = 6.67 \times 10^{-11}\) Nm\(^2\)/kg\(^2\).
<ul>
  <li>Find the work required to launch a rocket of mass 500,000 kg vertically upwards to a height of 10,000 km.
  <li>What if the rocket is moving at a rate of 0.5 km/sec and is burning fuel at a rate of 10 kg/sec?

<!--Tan section 5.4 exercise 29-->
<P> The graph of the equation \(x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} = a^{2/3}, a \geq 0\) is called an astroid. Find the arc length of this graph.<br>
  (hint: exploit symmetry)<br>

<P>A container having the shape of a solid of revolution obtained by revolving the graph of \(y= kx^4, k>0,\) about the \(y\)-axis is made with a transparent material.
  A small hole is drilled in the bottom to allow water to flow out.
  <ol type='a'>
    <li>Find the volume \(V(h)\) of water in the container as a function of \(h\), the height of the water at time \(t)\).
    <li>Use the chain rule and Torricelli's Law - which states that the rate of flow of water is \(dV/dt = \alpha A\sqrt{h}\), where \(\alpha\) is a negative constant, \(A\) is the area of the hole at the bottom of the container, and \(h\) is the height of the water- to show that the water level in the container drops at a constant rate.
    <li>Explain why this property allows us to construct a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_clock">water clock</a>.
  </ol>

</div>

<h2>Example  - volumes of revolution </h2>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#ex23">Example </button>
<div id="ex23" class="collapse">
  <P>Consider the region bounded by \(x=0,y=0,x=2,\) and \(y = x^2 + 2\).
    What is the volume created by rotating this region about the
    <ol>
      <li>\(x\) axis?
      <li>line \(y=6\)?
      <li>line \(x = 5\)?
      </ol>

<h2>Example  - work to pump tank </h2>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#ex24">Example </button>
<div id="ex24" class="collapse">
  <P> Consider a tank in the shape of an inverted cone with radius 5m and height 10m filled with water.
    What is the work required to pump all the water in this tank out a spout 2 m above the top of the tank?
  </div>

  <h2>Example  - force on plate </h2>
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#ex25">Example </button>
  <div id="ex25" class="collapse">
    <P> Let \(F\) be the fluid force on a side fo a semicircular plate of radius \(r\) meters submerged in Water
      so the diameter is level with the water surface. Calculate \(F\) as a function of \(r\).
    </div>


    <h2>Example - more pumping  </h2>
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#ex11">Example</button>
    <div id="ex11" class="collapse">
      <P> Consider emptying a trough full of water. the trough is 8 ft long and the ends are in the shape of a semicircle with radius 2 ft.
        We'll empty the tank by pumping the water out of a pipe extending 1 foot above the top of the trough.

      <p>Some tasks to think about:
        <ul>
          <li> Draw a picture of this situation.
          <li> Where should we place the origin in our coordinate system. Why?
          <li> What is the equation of a circle with radius \(R\) centered at the origin?
          <li> What direction should we slice to set up an integral? What is the thickness and shape of this slice?
          <li> Set up an integral representing the work done to empty the tank. (Note water has weight density 62.4 lbs/cubic ft. )
          <li> How would you go about evaluating this integral analytically? What strategies or techniques would you try?
        </ul>
    </div>

        <li> Find the work required to move a particle along a straight line from \(x=0\) to \(x=2\) with force \(F(x) = xe^{-3x}\).
        <li> A spring has a 20 cm natural length. What is the work required to stretch the spring to 30 cm long if \(k=2\) N/m?
        <li> Find the hydrostatic force on a circular plate of radius 2 that is submerged 6 meters in the water.
        <li> Find the area between \(x = y^2 - 1\) and \(y = -1 + x\).
        <li> Set up integrals for the coordinates of the center of mass of the shape above.

<div id="ex19" class="collapse">
<P> Consider stamping a flat metal sheet into a corrugted pattern 28 inches long with shape given by \(y = \sin(\pi x/7) \).
