  <h2>Big Idea </h2>
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#cv">Idea</button>
    <div id="cv" class="collapse">
      <P>The big idea for this lesson is that at a specific point on the graph of a function,
        the tangent line is a very good approximation of the function.
        This is true as long as the tangent line exists, i.e. the function is differentiable at that point.
        We can approximate values of complicated functions by following the procedure below.
      <ol type='1'>
      <li>Find a nice, easily evaluated point of a complicated function near the value we want to approximate. Call it \(x_0,f(x_0)\). <br><br>
      <li>Find the tangent line of this function at that point, i.e. \(y - f(x_0) = f'(x_0) (x - x_0)\).<br><br>
      <li>Let \(L(x) = y\) and rewrite this as \(L(x) = f'(x_0) (x - x_0) + f(x_0)\).
        \(L(x)\) is called the linear approximation of \(f\) or just the linearization. <br><br>
      <li>When \(x\approx x_0\) then \(L(x) \approx f(x)\) so to approximate \(f(x)\) we just evaluate \(L(x)\).
      </ol>
    </div>

<h2>Example - \(e^x\) near \(x=0\) </h2>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#gex3">Example</button>
  <div id="gex3" class="collapse">
    <P>Let's suppose we want to know the value of \(e^{0.1}\) without a calculator.
      Let's follow the steps above to approximate this value.<br>
      <dl type='1'>
      <dt>Find a nice, easily evaluated point of a complicated function near the value we want to approximate.</dt>
        <dd>0.1 is near 0 and \(e^0 =1\) is easily evaluated. \(x_0 = 0\) and \(f(x) = e^x\) here.  </dd>

      <dt>Find the tangent line of this function at that point, i.e. \(y - f(x_0) = f'(x_0) (x - x_0)\).</dt>
        <dd>\(f'(x) = e^x\) and \(f'(0) = 1\) so the tangent line is \(y - 1 = 1(x-0)\).</dd>
      <dt>Let \(L(x) = y\) and rewrite this as \(L(x) = f'(x_0) (x - x_0) + f(x_0)\). </dt>
        <dd>\(L(x) = 1+ x\)</dd>
      <dt>When \(x\approx x_0\) then \(L(x) \approx f(x)\) so to approximate \(f(x)\) we just evaluate \(L(x)\).</dt>
      <dd>\(L(0.1) = 1+ 0.1 = 1.1 \approx e^{0.1} = 1.10517...\). This is a pretty good approximation.</dd>

    </dl>


  </div>

<h2>Example -  </h2>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#gex5">Example</button>
  <div id="gex5" class="collapse">
    <P>Use linearization to approximate \(g(6)\) where \(g(x) = e^{x\sin x}\). Note that \(g(2\pi)\) is easily evaluated.
      <dl type='1'>
      <dt>Find a nice, easily evaluated point of a complicated function near the value we want to approximate.</dt>
        <dd>\(2\pi \approx 6.28..\) is near 6 and \(g(2\pi) = e^{2\pi \sin(2\pi)} = e^0 = 1\).  </dd>

      <dt>Find the tangent line of this function at that point, i.e. \(y - f(x_0) = f'(x_0) (x - x_0)\).</dt>
        <dd>(Don't forget product and chain rules!)<br>
          \(g'(x) = e^{x\sin x}(\sin x + x\cos x)\) and <br>\(g'(2\pi) = e^0 (\sin (2\pi) + 2\pi \cos(2\pi)) = 2\pi\)
          so the tangent line is \(y - 1 = 2\pi(x-2\pi)\).</dd>
      <dt>Let \(L(x) = y\) and rewrite this as \(L(x) = f'(x_0) (x - x_0) + f(x_0)\). </dt>
        <dd>\(L(x) = 2\pi(x-2\pi) + 1\)</dd>
      <dt>When \(x\approx x_0\) then \(L(x) \approx f(x)\) so to approximate \(f(x)\) we just evaluate \(L(x)\).</dt>
      <dd>\(L(6) = 2\pi(6-2\pi) =  -0.7793...\). This is a pretty good approximation.</dd>

<h2>Example -  </h2>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#gex33">Example</button>
  <div id="gex33" class="collapse">
    <P>The line \(y = 1\) is tangent to the graph of \(f(x) = \cos x\) at (0,1). This means that
      <ul>
        <li>(a) the only x-values for which y = 1 is a good estimate for y = cos x are those that
are close enough to 0.
      <li>(b) tangent lines can intersect the graph of f infinitely many times.
        <li>(c) the farther x is from 0, the worse the linear approximation is.
          <li>(d) All of the above
          </ul>
  </div>

<h2>Differentials  </h2>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#eex5">Idea</button>
  <div id="eex5" class="collapse">
    <P>Note from above that our tangent line near \(x_0,f(x_0)\) is \(y - f(x_0) = f'(x_0) (x - x_0)\).
      Think about the left hand side (LHS) of this equation: it is telling us about the small change we make in \(y\) values
      by moving a small amount in the \(x\) values along the tangent line. The quantity \(x-x_0\) on the RHS is this small amount.
      We can let \(\Delta y\) represent a small change in \(y\) while \(\Delta x\) represents a small change in \(x\).
      Then our tangent line equation begins to look like \(\Delta y = f'(x_0) \Delta x\).
      This makes sense since \(f'(x_0)\) is the slope of the tangent line and rearranging we see \(f'(x_0) = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\)
      or a rate of change. As we let \(Delta x\) shrink to 0, we say \(\Delta x \to dx\) and \(\Delta y \to dy\).
      We call \(dx,dy\) differentials and write \(dy = f'(x) dx\).
      These relate small changes in outputs of functions to small changes in inputs.

      <br>
      <br>
      <P>Example: Let \(y = x^4 + 2x + 1\). Then \(y' = \frac{dy}{dx} = 4x^3 + 2\) and we can write the differential
        form \(dy = (4x^3 + 2) dx\).

    <h2>Differentials - Error  </h2>
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#err">Example</button>
      <div id="err" class="collapse">
        <P> The small changes used above to define differentials also could represent error in measurements.
          Consider computing the area of a square with side lengths 2 cm,
          but there is error in the measurement of the side length \(\pm 0.1\) cm.
          What is the maximum error in the area calculation?

          <div id="cv1" class="collapse">
            <P> We can use a tangent line approximation to \(\sqrt{x}\) to approximate square roots of numbers.
              If we do that for each of the square roots below, for which one would we get the smallest error?
