<h2>SIR</h2>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#river">SIR</button>
<div id="river" class="collapse">

  <P>The system below is a set of 3 equations in 3 unknowns known as the SIR equations. They are used to model disease outbreaks.
    In this model \(S(t)\) represents the fraction of the population who are susceptible to a disease at time \(t\), \(I(t)\) is the fraction infected with the disease, and \(R(t)\) is the fraction removed.
    $$\frac{dS}{dt} = -a S I$$
    $$\frac{dI}{dt} = a S I - b I $$
    $$\frac{dR}{dt} = bI $$
    This system consists of three coupled, nonlinear equations. In general we cannot solve such systems analytically.
  The applet below solves these equations numerically with different values of \(a\) and \(b\) and assumes that 1% of the population is infected initially. Plots of \(S,I,R\) as functions of time are shown in blue, red, and green, respectively.<br>

 <p>To do: <ol type='1'>
 <li> Explore the system. What do you think \(a,b\) represent? What are their units?
 <li> Can you explain each equation in common language?
 <li> How many ways can a person be in the 'removed' population?
 <li> What quantity being positive is associated with the disease spreading?
 <li> When is the maximum infection rate?
 <li> Assume at time 0, \(I(0)=0.01, a=0.25, b=0.1\). Can you figure out a the minimum fraction of the population that would need to be vaccinated to prevent the disease from spreading (i.e. an outbreak)?

<h2>Spring motion</h2>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#bb">spring motion</button>
<div id="bb" class="collapse">
<img src="./massspring.png" width=300><br>
<P>Consider the mass-spring system above (moving on a frictionless table). Hooke's Law states that the force due to the spring \(F_{spring}=-kx\) where \(k >0 \) is the spring constant. Large values of \(k\) are associated with stiffer springs.
<P>To Do:<ol type='1'>
  <li> Use Netwon's second law to build a differential equation that describes the horizontal displacment (motion), \(x(t)\), of a mass, \(m\), on the end of a spring with spring constant \(k\).
  <li> What is the order of your differential equation?
  <li> With resorting to an analytical technique to solve the system, can you find a solution via guess and check?
  <li> Does your knowledge of your guessed solution match what you'd expect from the behavior of a spring? Why or why not?

<h2>Chemical reactions</h2>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#gest">chemical reactions</button>
<div id="gest" class="collapse">
<P>Consider the chemical reaction where reactants \(A\) and \(B\) combine to make product \(C\).
$$A + B \to C$$

<P>The law of mass action states that rate of the chemical reaction is proportional to the amounts of the reactants available, i.e. if there is a lot of \(A\) and \(B\) around then the reaction produces \(C\) quickly, if not then slowly.
Let \(x(t)\) be the amount of chemical \(C\) produced at time \(t\). Let \(a\) and \(b\) be the initial amounts of \(A\) and \(B\), respectively.

<P>To Do:<ol type='1'>
  <li> Explain why the chemical reaction is modeled with the differential equation
    $$\frac{dx}{dt} = k (a-x)(b-x).$$
  <li> What is the initial condition, i.e. \(x(0) = \)?
  <li> Use the fact this is separable and partial fractions to find a solution to teh IVP.

<h2>More Tanks </h2>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#ex2">More Tanks</button>
<div id="ex2" class="collapse">

<ol type='A'>
  <li> Consider a 100 gallon tank filled with saltwater. We want to flush out the salt and replace it with fresh water.
    We will accomplish this by pouring in pure water at a rate of 5 gal/min and letting the mixture flow out at 5 gal/min.
    Assume the mixture in the tank is always perfectly mixed.
    <ol type='1'>
      <li> If there is initially 10 lbs of salt in the tank how much is there at time \(t\)?
      <li> How long until there is less than 0.1 lbs of salt in the tank?
    </ol>

  <li> Now consider a 50 gallon tank of pure water. Saltwater with concentration 2 lbs/gal is pumped in at a rate of 3 gal/min, is continuously mixed, and flows out at 3 gal/min.
    <ol type='1'>
      <li> Set up an IVP describing this situation.
      <li> Describe the DE using vocubulary we have learned thus far.
      <li> Solve this system. Is there a particular method that is aimed at this type of problem?
