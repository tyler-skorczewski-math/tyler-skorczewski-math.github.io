<h2>Example 1 - Wire resistivity</h2>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#ex2">Example 1</button>
  <div id="ex2" class="collapse">



<P>The resistivity \(\rho\) of a conducting wire is the reciprocal of the conductivity and is measured in units of ohm-meters (\(\Omega\)-m). The resistivity of a given metal depends on the temperature according to the equation

$$\rho(t)=\rho_{20}e^{\alpha(t-20)}$$

where \(t\) is the temperature in \(^o\)C. There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistivity_and_conductivity#Resistivity_and_conductivity_of_various_materials">tables</a> that list the values of \(\alpha\) (called the temperature coefficient) and \(\rho_{20}\) (the resistivity
at \(20^o\)C) for various metals. Except at very low temperatures, the resistivity varies almost linearly with temperature and so it is common to approximate the
 expression
for \(\rho(t)\) by its first- or second-degree Taylor polynomial about \(t=20\). Find expressions for these linear and quadratic approximations.

For copper, \(\alpha=0.0039/^o\)C and \(\rho_{20}=1.7\times 10^{-8}\) \(\Omega\)-m. Calculate the error in your linear and quadratic approximations when the temperatures are (a) \(-250^o\)C, (b) \(420^o\)C, (c) \(80^o\)C .

<h2>Example 2 - Special relativity </h2>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#ex4">Example 2</button>
<div id="ex4" class="collapse">
<P> Einstein's special relativity is used for particles that are moving at speeds which are close to the speed of light. In special relativity, the energy of the particle is given by

\[E(\beta)=Mc^2=\frac{mc^2}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2}}\]

where \(c\) is the speed of light, \(M\) is the relativistic mass, \(m\) is the rest mass, and \(\beta= v/c\) where \(v\) is the velocity of the particle. This relationship between the relativistic mass and the rest mass is given by

\[M=\frac{m}{\sqrt{1-(v/c)^2}}\]

and is based on the Lorentz transformation \(T = \gamma t\) where \(\gamma =\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-(v/c)^2}}\),which was known to mathematicians before Einstein developed the theory of special relativity. This particular relationship tells us that to an outside observer, the mass of a particle in motion increases with the speed of the particle, and is infinite in the limit \(v \to c\).

What if the speed \(v\) is small compared to the speed of light? The energy equation of special relativity should reduce to the energy equation of Newtonian (classical) mechanics \(E=\frac{1}{2}mv^2\) when \(v/c \approx 0\) (this is the familiar kinetic energy you see in your physics classes). Expand \(E(\beta)\) in a Taylor series in \(\beta\) about \(\beta= 0\) and show that \(E(\beta)\approx mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}mv^2\).

Note: The quantity \(mc^2\) is called the rest energy, since we are only interested in energy difference between particles moving at different velocities:

\[E_1-E_2=\left(mc^2+\frac{1}{2}mv_1^2\right)-\left(mc^2+\frac{1}{2}mv_2^2\right)=\frac{1}{2}m(v_1^2-v_2^2)\]

so the classical energy is given by \(E =\frac{1}{2}mv^2\) (which gives the same value for \(E_1-E_2\)).

<P>An enthusiastic math student, having discovered that

\[\ln x= (x-1)-\frac{(x-1)^2}{2}+\frac{(x-1)^3}{3}-\cdots\]

decides to save money by not buying the scientific feature on his new calculator,
figuring that all he has to do is to use this formula to calculate \(\ln x\). Being somewhat lazy, he decides that the formula

\[\ln x=(x-1)-\frac{(x-1)^2}{2}\]

is "probably accurate to three decimal places." Comment on this speculation with complete and concise sentences and give example(s) of when this speculation fails.

Your friend tells you that the formula}

\[\ln x=(x-1)-\frac{(x-1)^2}{2}\]

is "definitely accurate to three decimal places provided \(x\) is close enough to 1." How close? <!--(Hint: Use Alternating Series Estimation Theorem)-->
