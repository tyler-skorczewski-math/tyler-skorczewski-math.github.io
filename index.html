  <div id="about">
    <h3>About me</h3>
    <P>I am in the applied mathematics faculty at the University of Wisconsin Stout. Before this I held academic appointments at Cornell College and the University of Utah. I earned my PhD in Applied Mathematics from the University of California Davis in 2010 under Dr. Angela Cheer.

  <div id="teaching">
    <h3>Teaching</h3>
    <p>My goal as a teacher is to develop a relationship with each student to create a learning environment where students develop the confidence and ability to approach topics in science and technology with mathematical thinking and proper communication of results.<br><br>

    <P>I am an <a href="http://www.maa.org/programs/faculty-and-departments/project-next">MAA Project NExT</a> Gold Dot.<br><br>

    <P><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/01/170116171400.htm">Science Daily</a> recently highlighted a undergraduate research project of mine with Drew Klocke.<br><br>

    <P>In Spring 2017 I taught a <a href="http://www.maa.org/pic-math">PIC Math</a> course.<br><br>

    <P><a href="./sipd/index.html">Here is a review game for partial derivatives based on the game Spot-it!</a> I also have developed paper versions for other math concepts, like trigonometry.<br><br>

    <P><u>Classes</u>
    <ul>
    <li>Univ California Davis: Vector Analysis, Collaborative Learning at the Interface of Mathematics and Biology (CLIMB)
    <li>Univ Utah: Calculus II, Engineering Calculus II, Differential Equations and Linear Algebra
    <li>Cornell College: Single Variable Calculus, Multivariable Calculus, Calculus with Precalculus, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Mathematical Modeling, Scientific Computing, Mathematical Models in Biology, Partial Differential Equations, Preparation for Industial Careers in Mathematics (PIC Math), Statisical Methods I
    <li>Univ Wisc Stout: Finite and Financial Mathematics, Calculus II
    </ul>
    <p>What students say:
    <ul>
    <li>"Class was fun to go to. Math is not a subject that I would call my 'favorite' but this is a class that
I always enjoyed going to."
    <li>"Such a great teacher. I learned more than I thought I would."
    <li>"The availability of Dr. S to the students was by far the best I have experienced in my university experience. My success was based in his willingness to help."
    <li>"Dr. Skorczewski went out of his way to make time for his students outside of regular class hours and office hours. This was a saving grace for many of us in the class. [He] made sure that no one was left behind. Until now, I've honestly never had a math class where I could say we covered all of the material or even that I understood most of it. He may be a research professor, but he's a damned fine lecturer too."
    <li>"... was always willing to help students and highly encouraged any questions in class. He also worked hard to get to know his students and it improved the overall environment of the class."
    <li>"His lectures were very good; it is hard to make a 2 hour math lecture enthralling, but somehow Professor Skorczewski did it."

    <h3>Research</h3>
    <P>My research interests include working with mathematical models in biology and industrial applications, along with scientific computation and simulation.
    At the University of Utah, I was working with Dr. Aaron Fogelson modeling blood clotting.
    My doctoral dissertation is concerned with simulating the flow of suction feeding in fish.
    Other work I have done includes fluid mechanics of absorption, surface science of paper products and various sensor physics problems while at Kimberly-Clark.
    I have also worked on projects dealing with the design of liquid crystal displays, hard disk air bearings, and the design of RF MEMS switches. <br><br>
