<h2>Example 1 - Rumors</h2>

<P> Consider a rumor spreading throughout a school with \(P\) people. Let \(N(t) \) be the number of people who have heard the rumor at time \(t \).
Consider the models for the dynamics of the rumor below. Assume \(k > 0 \).
<ol type='a'>
<li>$$\frac{dN}{dt} = k N$$
<li>$$\frac{dN}{dt} = k (P - N)$$
<li>$$\frac{dN}{dt} = k (N - P)$$
<li>$$\frac{dN}{dt} = k N (N-P)$$
<li>$$\frac{dN}{dt} = k N (P-N)$$
<li>$$\frac{dN}{dt} = k N^2 (P-N)$$
</ol>
<br>
<ol type='1'>
<li> Which models above plausibly describe the situation? Why? (There is at least one.)
<li> Pick one of the models you think is plausible and translate the differential equation to a sentence with words.
<li> What assumptions do we make when building these models?
<li> What are the units of \(k\) in your plausible models? Are they the same for each?
<li> Let \(C\) be a constant number. For which of the first three models is \(N(t) = P - Ce^{-kt}\) a solution?
  What does it mean for something to solve a differential equation?
  Is this different from algebraic equations?
<li> Assume \(N(t)\) has the form immediately above and that \(N(0) = N_0\). Find \(C\). What are the units of \(C\)? Does it represent anything?
