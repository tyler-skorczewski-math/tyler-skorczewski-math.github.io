  <P> You are working in a laboratory that does experiments with animals. The animals in one particular experiment
    are to be kept on a strict diet of 20 grams protein and 6 grams fat each day. There are two food mixes the lab uses.
    Mix A has 10% protein and 6% fat. Mix B has 20% protein and 2% fat. Your task is to determine how many grams of each mix
    should be used to obtain the right diet for a single animal.
<ol type='1'>

<P><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_Six_Sigma">Lean</a> <a href="https://www.leanproduction.com/">manufacturing</a> is a corporate philosophy or operation strategy built around eliminating waste. This includes waste in inventory, production, and labor.

<P>Consider a factory that makes down jackets, vests, and comforters. A jacket requires 3 lbs of down, a vest 2 lbs, and a comforter 4 lbs.
  A jacket takes 2 hours of labor to make, a vest requires 1 hour of labor, and a comforter also requires 1 hour.
  The profit from jackets and vests are $6 each, and the profit from a comforter is $2.

<P>Each week the factory has exactly 600 pounds of down, 275 available manhours and wants a weekly profit of $1150. How many jackets, vests, and comforters should it produce in order to eliminate any excesses in down and labor hours?

<h2>Example 4 - Kirchoff's Laws </h2>

  <P>The multiloop circuit shown above has two junctions and three branches carrying currents, \(I_1, I_2, I3\).
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff%27s_circuit_laws">Kirchoff's Voltage Law</a> says that the sum of the voltage drops around any loop must be zero.
    The voltage drop across a resistor is given by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm%27s_law">Ohm's Law</a> (\(V = IR\)) where \(I\) is the current and \(R\) is the resistance.
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff%27s_circuit_laws">Kirchoff's Current Law</a> says that the sum of the currents at any junction must be zero (direction is important).
    <ol type='1'>
      <li>Explain why the system below for the currents follows from Kirchoff's Laws.
        $$I_1 + I_3 - I_2 = 0$$

        $$4I_1 + 2 I_2 + 3I_3 = 5$$
