<h2>Example 1 - Fish populations</h2>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#ex1">Example 1</button>
  <div id="ex1" class="collapse">
  <!--<img src="./lakemenomin.jpg" width=350><br>-->

<P> Consider a population of fish in a lake. One of the most common starting points biologists use to model a population in a closed environment is the logistic equation:
  $$ \frac{dP}{dt} = kP \left( 1 - \frac{P}{N}\right). $$
  Here, \(P(t)\) is the population at time \(t\), and \(k,N > 0 \) are the intrinsic growth rate and population carrying capacity, respectively.


<ol type='1'>
<li> Explain why \(N\) is called the carrying capacity. Use both mathematical and biological reasoning.
<li> Make a slope field using dfield (<a href="./dfield.jar">dfield.jar</a>). Let \(k=0.1\) and \(N=10\). Plot a few solutions and explain what is happening.
<li> Label this equation using vocabulary from the course.
<li> Use the fact that this equation is separable and find a general solution for the DE. You can assume \( 0 < P < N\) when solving.
<li> Let \(P(0) = P_0\) and find a particular solution.
<li> Now assume that we introduce some harvesting, in the form of fishing. Let the harvesting occur at a constant rate, \(h\). How should we modify our DE?
<li> Find any equilibrium solutions to the new DE.
<li> Make new slope fields with some values of \(h\). How does increasing \(h\) affect the population?

<h2>Example 2 - Tanks </h2>

<ol type='A'>
  <li> Consider a 100 gallon tank filled with saltwater. We want to flush out the salt and replace it with fresh water.
    We will accomplish this by pouring in pure water at a rate of 5 gal/min and letting the mixture flow out at 5 gal/min.
    Assume the mixture in the tank is always perfectly mixed.
    <ol type='1'>
      <li> If there is initially 10 lbs of salt in the tank how much is there at time \(t\)?
      <li> How long until there is less than 0.1 lbs of salt in the tank?
    </ol>

  <li> Now consider a 50 gallon tank of pure water. Saltwater with concentration 2 lbs/gal is pumped in at a rate of 3 gal/min, is continuously mixed, and flows out at 3 gal/min.
    <ol type='1'>
      <li> Set up an IVP describing this situation.
      <li> Describe the DE using vocubulary we have learned thus far.

<h2>Example 3 - Drugs in the bloodstream </h2>

  Consider taking a pill. The pill dissolves and enters the bloodstream at a rate proportional to the amount left in the pill.
  The body metabolizes the drug in the bloodstream at a rate proportional to the amount in the bloodstream.
  <ol type='1'>
  <li> Come up with a system of differential equations that describe this system. Let \(A\) be the amount of drug in the pill and \(C\) be the amount in the bloodstream.
  <li> Let \(A(0) = A_0\) be the initial amount in the pill. Solve your IVP for \(A(t)\).
  <li> Use your solution above to find \(C(t)\).
  <li> Perform some sanity checks on your solution for \(C(t)\). Do the units work? Is \(C(t) \ge 0\)? Should it be?
  <li> Sketch a graph of \(C(t)\).
  <li> When is the amount of drug in the bloodstream at a maximum?
  <li> How is this related to the tank problems in the text or above?

Imagine an apple pie just coming out of a 375 degree oven and resting on the counter in a kitchen at 75 degrees.
We can't eat it until it has cooled down to 100 degrees. Let's use Newton's Law of Cooling with insulation constant 4/min to find the time it takes for the pie to cool.
<ol type='1'>
<li> Explain Newton's Law of Cooling in your own words.

<P> Lake Erie has a total volume of 458 cubic kilometers. Assume the inflow/outflow rate are equal and 175 km\(^3\)/yr.
  Suppose at \(t=0\) the pollutant concentration is 0.05% and for \(t > 0\) pollutant concentration inflow is 0.01%.
  If we assume the lake is perfectly mixed (it is not), how long will it take until the lake has a pollutant concentration of 0.02\%?
